👋 Hi, I’m Kamel, also known as @KamsNyc.
👀 I’m interested in designing user interfaces in Figma and developing full-stack websites.
🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my skills in web development through the #100devs course and daily coding challenges on Codewars.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to web development, UI/UX design, or any exciting opportunities in the tech industry.
🏙️ I'm based in Queens, NYC.
🏀 On weekends, you can find me playing basketball and staying active.
💼 I work for a small e-commerce company and have a side job where I've built a small business on eBay.
🛠️ I love being creative and working on using my skills to unlock opportunities in other fields.
