👋 Hi, I’m Kamel, also known as @KamsNyc.
👀 I’m interested in designing user interfaces in Figma and developing full-stack websites.
🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my skills in web development through the #100devs course and daily coding challenges on Codewars.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to web development, UI/UX design, or any exciting opportunities in the tech industry.
🏙️ I'm based in Queens, NYC.
🏀 On weekends, you can find me playing basketball and staying active.
💼 I work five days a week, and I also have a side job where I've built a small business on eBay.
🛠️ I started by creating websites on Shopify for business purposes, and I've expanded my skills to encompass the full stack of web development.
